# N8N_Email_Management
AI-Powered Email Management—Built with n8n, ChatGPT, and Google Workspace

Inbox overload is a challenge many professionals face. To solve this, I developed an AI-powered Email Management workflow using n8n, Gmail, ChatGPT (GPT-4), and Google Sheets—automating how emails are sorted, responded to, and organized.

Here’s what this intelligent system does:

✅ Categorizes Emails Automatically
Incoming emails are analyzed and labeled into categories like:

Promotions | Social Sales | Receipts | Recruitment | Personal

📌 Takes Smart, Predefined Actions Based on Each Category

Promotions → Marked as read
Social → Summarized and logged in Google Sheets
Personal → Draft replies are generated for review
Sales → Automatic responses are sent
Receipts → Forwarded directly to accounting
Other → Notifications can be pushed to platforms like Telegram or Twilio

🔁 Behind the Scenes

Gmail Trigger: Activates on every new email
ChatGPT: Analyzes and classifies content
n8n Automation: Routes each email to the correct flow
Google Sheets: Used for logging and visibility

🎯 The goal? To declutter the inbox, reduce response times, and save hours of manual work—letting you focus on what truly matters.
